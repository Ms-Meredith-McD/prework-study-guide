# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

The motivation for this project was learn how to code in GitBash, build a website in VS using HTML, CSS and JavaScript, and track my versions using Git.  The website is a study guide for taking notes on the 4 new types of tools I'm learning how to use together for the first time. I was able to successfully write code in GitBash, manage versions using GitHub so I could do my work locally by creating branches, pushing them to GitHub and merging them into the main branch.  I learned how to build the structure of the webpage with HTML, the style of the webpage with CSS, and add functionality to the webpage with JavaScript functions.

## Usage

Each section of the webpage contains notes about each topic I've started learning about - HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Git.  If you open the DevTools console, you can see the JavaScript running.  The JavaScript lists the topics I learned and chooses one topic to study first.  If you refresh the webpage, it chooses a different topic because I've added a randomizer function with JavaScript.
